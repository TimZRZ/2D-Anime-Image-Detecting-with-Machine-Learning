How to Execute:  
Before executing any python file, please downloard the raw data "all_data.csv" from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_NI03b-k1tBfXllhDfpH6PAlPKyl9GXx/view?usp=sharing  
  
If you want to do a fast execute without downloading data using python programs. Please download the rest of data from google drive links:

anime_images.zip (actually used in training): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JJLjCw-P5fE6YSKix7H7Hkd1_wQo1W3k/view?usp=sharing  
test_images.zip (whole image dataset for testing): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uxMRIeHG-C4kk81jGfix4qMqDxV0KY7C/view?usp=sharing  
(Links of all those datas are also stored in "dataLink.txt")
